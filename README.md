# FelipeCSayHelloEndpoint

Instructions: 
Run the debug on the code.
In Postman open a new request window. 
Type in https://localhost:7186/     ***This is the port number you obtained after you debugged the C# program. It is found in the debug console. Yours may differ.****
Then type in sayhello/greet/  *******This is the name of the controller and endpoint route to target*********
Then type in your name.
It should all look similar to this https://localhost:7186/sayhello/greet/{your name goes here}

Peer review by Andrew Nilsson: Inputs work well. Really cool that you can enter the inputs inside the web browser. I like the extra fun parts of the string that is returned.
